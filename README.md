## Spring MVC Film CRUD Project

### Description:
This application allows a user to search for, add, update, or delete a film from a SQL database. From the home page, the user is able to choose from a list of menu options. Those options include; 
<ul>
	<li>Find Film by ID</li>
	<li>Find Film by Keyword</li>
	<li>Create Film</li>
	<li>Delete Film</li>
	<li>Update Film</li>
	<li>Find Actor by ID</li>
	<li>Create Actor</li>
</ul>  
When a film is found by using its ID, the search will return all details specific to that film. Below the film details, the user is given the option to delete or edit the film. If the user selects delete, the film will be deleted and removed from the database. If the user selects edit film, they will be directed to a new page where they're able to edit the films title, description, release year, rental duration, length, and replacement cost. 

If a film is searched for by a keyword, the search will return a list of films where that keyword can be found within the tile or description. Similarly to the use options above, the user will be able to delete or edit the film. In either case, if a film cannot be found the user will be supplied with an error message.

### Lessons Learned:
This project was extremely beneficial to or understanding, comprehension, and implementation on all things listed above. Working on this project as a team, communicating back and forth, adding, committing, pulling and pushing to create the final project was a lot of fun. The key to success was organization. With all of the moving parts and more files we've ever seen, it was easy to get off track, add logic in the wrong spot, or miss something. When we faced an error, we worked through it together, step by step, communicating back and forth so nothing was overlooked.
